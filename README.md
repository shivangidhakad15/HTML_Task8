## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the registration form markup.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the registration form.

## Usage

To use the registration form, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The registration form will be displayed on the browser window.
4. Fill in the required information in the form fields, such as name, email, phone number, etc.
5. Click the submit button to submit the form.

## Customization

You can customize the registration form according to your requirements. Here are some possible customization options:

1. **Form Fields**: You can add, remove, or modify the form fields in the `index.html` file. Each form field is represented by a `<tr>` element within the table structure. Modify the `<input>` tags to change the type or attributes of the input fields.

2. **Styles**: The appearance of the registration form can be customized by modifying the CSS styles defined in the `styles.css` file. You can change the colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of the form.

3. **Validation**: If you need to add form validation, such as required fields or specific input formats, you can add JavaScript code to validate the form before submitting it. You can do this by adding an event listener to the submit button and implementing the validation logic in a separate JavaScript file.
